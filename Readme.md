# What is this?
Backend for my web app [kzgo.eu](https://kzgo.eu/servers) which allows players of the CSGO community gamemode kreedz to display many different statistics.

I originally did not intend for any of this to be public (both the code and the api itself), but some people actually started using this api for their own projects, so I thought I might as well show them what is behind the scenes. Feel free to yoink some code if it is useful to you.

I know a lot of people would also be interested in the frontend code, but I am not publishing it for a while, simply because I am ashamed of the code. This project was my learning project, and now that I have learned a lot, I can tell you the code is garbage and it will take a long time to fix. (not saying that this one is perfect, there are still a lot of things I want to improve)
